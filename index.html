<li> The visualization shares a multi series line chart where each line is used to represent a different team</li>
<li> The spikes in the line chart indicate the position of the team at the end of each game week among the twenty contenders</li>
<li> The user can use the position of the teams after each gameweek or for a certain month to visualize the form and how the team fared over the entire season</li>
<li> In order to track the performance of a single team the user can hover over the line chart of desired team to view the performance after each match in the selected season</li>
<li> On clicking the legend of the selected team we can add/remove the team form line from the visualization and can consider the teams that have their forms represented by darker lines</li>
<li>A slider box is provided at the bottom to allow brushing in order to enable users to dive deeper into the details and perform analysis for a shorter duration</li>
<li>The club emblems are given at the top of the page which change as per the season, replacing the three relegated teams with newly promoted teams from the championships</li>
<li>The club emblems are also linked to the official websites of the teams allowing the user to research more about a specific team in detail</li>
<li>On hovering over the line, the line darkens hence giving us a better view of the form and a tooltip shows up that provides us with the name of the team, month and the year of that instance on the line graph</li>
